# Rickover Quotes

"Responsibility is a unique concept... You may share it with others, but your portion is not diminished. You may delegate it, but it is still with you... If responsibility is rightfully yours, no evasion, or ignorance or passing the blame can shift the burden to someone else. Unless you can point your finger at the man who is responsible when something goes wrong, then you have never had anyone really responsible."  
-Hyman G. Rickover

-Hyman G. Rickover

"Optimism and stupidity are nearly synonymous."
